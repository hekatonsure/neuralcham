Not being suited for shepherding, it was very tiring for the sheep doing the work, and was stressful for the sheep being driven, too.\n\nOne day, a new ram was introduced to the flock. He thought this was a very curious arrangement. He said to one of the other rams, \"Why are we in charge of keeping order amongst the ewes, and they in charge of keeping order amongst the rams? Doesn't this mutual antagonism engender animosity when mating season comes around?\"\n\nThe other ram replied, \"Like it or not, we always herd the ones we love.\"",
